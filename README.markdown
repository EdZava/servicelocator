What's in ServiceLocator?
=========================
Delphi implementation of the [Service Locator pattern](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#UsingAServiceLocator)  

I use it for IoC in iOS apps, as it is much more light-weight than a DI container, while still giving many of the benefits.
